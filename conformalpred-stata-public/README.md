# conformalpred

Split-conformal prediction intervals for Stata's `regress` and `poisson`.

`conformalpred` wraps an ordinary regression and adds prediction intervals
that do not rest on normal or homoskedastic errors. It randomly splits the
estimation sample into a training half and a calibration half, refits the
model on the training half, measures the absolute prediction errors on the
calibration half, and widens every prediction by the calibration quantile of
those errors. The output is two new variables — `cp_lower` and `cp_upper` by
default — holding an interval for every observation the model can predict
for, including observations whose outcome is missing (useful for scoring a
holdout).

The method is split-conformal prediction (Shafer & Vovk 2008). Its coverage
guarantee is exact in finite samples and free of distributional assumptions:
because a new observation drawn like the calibration data is equally likely
to fall at any rank among the calibration errors, an interval of
plus-or-minus the ceil((1-alpha)(n+1))-th smallest calibration error covers
the new outcome with probability at least 1-alpha. The only requirement is
exchangeability — new points drawn like the calibration points.

Version 0.1.0 supports `regress` (intervals around the linear prediction)
and `poisson` (intervals around the predicted count). Intervals have
constant width across observations; `logit` is excluded because a
plus-or-minus band around a predicted probability is not a meaningful
interval for a 0/1 outcome. The split is random, so set `seed()` whenever
you need reproducible bounds.

net install conformalpred, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericabooth/conformalpred-stata-public/main/") replace
```

From a local copy of this folder:

```

## Quick start

```stata
sysuse nlsw88, clear
conformalpred, command(regress wage grade tenure) alpha(0.1) seed(20260706)
list wage cp_lower cp_upper in 1/5
display "half-width Q = " r(Q) ", target coverage = " r(coverage_target)
```

Options: `alpha(#)` miscoverage rate (default 0.05), `seed(#)` reproducible
split, `split(#)` training fraction (default 0.5), `prefix(name)` stub for
the generated variables (default `cp`).

## Stored results

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `r(Q)` | conformal quantile (interval half-width) |
| `r(alpha)` | miscoverage rate requested |
| `r(n_calib)` | number of calibration observations |
| `r(coverage_target)` | 1 - alpha |
| `r(n_train)` | number of training observations |
| `r(split)` | training fraction requested |
| `r(cmd)` | estimator used (`regress` or `poisson`) |
| `r(depvar)` | dependent variable |
| `r(prefix)` | prefix of the generated bound variables |

After the call, `e()` holds the training-half fit, not a full-sample fit.
